## SENSITIVITY
##
###############################################################################
## Beginning with version GeigerLog 1.0 the 'Calibration' is replaced with
## 'Sensitivity', which is defined as the inverse of the previous definitions,
## i.e. 0.0065 µSv/h/CPM becomes 1/0.065 => 153.85 CPM/(µSv/h).
## This is rounded to 154 CPM/(µSv/h) to use no more than 3 valid digits.
## For reasons for this change see the GeigerLog manual, but in short a tube with
## a higher number for Sensitivity now does have a higher sensitivity!
###############################################################################

# The GMC factory default so-called calibration factor is linear, i.e. the same
# for all 3 calibration points defined in a GMC counter. For a M4011 tube the
# calibration factor implemented in firmware is 0.0065 µSv/h/CPM.
#
# For the 2nd tube in a GMC500+ device, different factors were seen:
# E.g.: from a calibration point #3 setting of '25 CPM=4.85µSv/h' the calibration
# factor is 0.194 µSv/h/CPM. While a calibration point #3 setting of '25CPM=9.75µSv/h'
# results in 0.39 µSv/h/CPM!
#
# However, these are significantly different from calibration factors determined
# in my own experiments as reported here:
# http://www.gqelectronicsllc.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=5369, see Reply #10,
# Quote: “With Thorium = 0.468, and K40 = 0.494, I'd finally put the sensitivity
# of the 2nd tube, the SI3BG, to 0.48 µSv/h/CPM, which makes it 74 fold less
# sensitive than the M4011!”
#
# Others report even poorer values for the SI3BG:
# https://www.gqel
# ectronicsllc.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=5554, Reply #17
# "The new correction factor for the primarily gamma tube is .881CPM/uSv/h or 1.135."
# This means sensitivity of that (2nd) tube = 1.135 µSv/h/CPM


# Default Sensitivity
# A total of 4 tubes are configured. They are strictly associated with the variables. So when
# a variable XYZ is configured for any device, then the sensitivity for variable XYZ will be used.
# In GMC counters their meaning is special.

<h3>Firmware bugs in some devices</h3>

<p><b>Device: GMC-500+</b></p>

<p>When this device is on firmware 1.18 it identifies itself with an empty identifier,
which prohibits use on GeigerLog. It should identify itself as 'GMC-500+Re 1.18'.</p>

<p>A work-around is to cycle the connection: ON -> OFF -> ON. Then it should work.</p>

<p>This bug is corrected with firmware 1.21. It is recommended to contact GMC support for an update.
The Geiger counter will then identify itself as 'GMC-500+Re 1.21'.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><b>Device: GMC-500 / 600 series</b></p>
<p>Some firmware versions, at least 1.18 and 1.21, have a bug (called 'location bug') which
results in errors in the parsing of the <b>history</b> file. It is advised to upgrade at least to
the 1.22 firmware!</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p><b>"Fast EstimateTime"</b></p>

<p>This mode is active by default in its worst setting! It invokes an algorithm
 - not disclosed by GQ - which results in a severe distortion of all CPM
 recordings, and may even create counts when there are none.</p>

<p>Present as a configuration setting in Device GMC-500+ version 2.24 and
likely in all other models with a firmware supporting this mode.</p>

<p>It has settings of 60, 30, 20, 15, 10 and 5 seconds, plus a 'dynamic' setting,
which apparently simply stands for 3 seconds. The latter is the default and the
worst setting.</p>

<p>It looks like this algorithm is switched off at 60 seconds, therefore that
setting is strongly recommended! GeigerLog gives a warning when a GMC counter is
activated with this setting at anything besides 60 seconds.</p>

<p>A firmware correction has NOT been announced.</p>

<H3>Radiation World Maps</H3>

<p>Several web sites exist which attempt to show a worldwide map of the
<b>BACKGROUND</b> radioactivity, hoping to be of help to the people in case of
a nuclear emergency, which will result in elevated levels of radioactivity.
Some are run by governments, others by enthusiastic hobbyists.</p>

<p>Among the latter ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href='http://www.gmcmap.com/' >gmcmap.com</a> - This is the one supported by GQ Electronics</li>
<li><a href='https://radmon.org/index.php' >radmon.org</a> - Opened again after hacking episode</li>
<li><a href='https://blog.safecast.org/' >safecast.org</a> - Accepting radiation as well as air quality data</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently only GQ's GMCmap is supported by GeigerLog; others may follow.</p>

<p>GQ suggests to use your Geiger counter (versions with WiFi, i.e.
GMC-320+V5, GMC-500, GMC-600 series) to directly update their website.
See the GeigerLog manual for why this is actually not such a good idea.</p>

<p>But you can also support their worldmap using GeigerLog, and not only
provide more meanigful data, but use any of their non-WiFi counters just as
well.</p>

<p>If you want to contibute to <a href='http://www.gmcmap.com/' >gmcmap.com</a>,
you need to register there.
This provides you with a UserID and a CounterID. Enter both into the
respective fields in the GeigerLog configuration file 'geigerlog.cfg' under
the heading 'Worldmaps'. That's it!</p>

<p>Click the toolbar icon 'Map' and you'll be presented with a dialogue box,
allowing you to configure how you send your data to the map. Obviously, for this to
succeed you need to have an active internet connection at your computer!</p>

<p>You will see a confirmation printed to GeigerLog's NotePad area.<br></p>

<H3>A word of caution:</H3>
<p>As far as I can see there is no quality control of the data! Nothing
prevents users from putting a strong radioactive source in front of their detector,
and pushing these data to the web. In fact, you don't even need a counter, and
don't even need GeigerLog, but can enter any data you wish manually!
Also, there does not seem to be a way to re&shy;tract any inadvertently
sent data. Poor data will quickly destroy any value of those sites.</p>

<p>Even more subtle things may reduce the value of those websites: Geiger
counter readings fluktuate quite significantly. Thus when individual, single
readings are posted, the values maybe significantly higher or lower than the
average, suggesting changes that don't exist.</p>

<p>GeigerLog will always send the average of the data you configured in the update
cycle. And GeigerLog uses this average for both CPM and ACPM, and calculates
uSV based on it. I suggest to have values assembled for at least 30 minutes,
more is better, before sending anything to the maps. Governmental sites like this
<a href='https://www.naz.ch/de/aktuell/tagesmittelwerte'>Swiss site</a>
provide even only DAILY averages of quality controlled data! See the GeigerLog
manual for a broader discussion.

<p><span style='color:darkblue; font:bold; font-size:x-large;'>GeigerLog</span>
is a combination of data logger, data presenter, and data analyzer.</p>

<p>It is based on Python (Version 3), hence it runs on Linux, Windows, Macs,
and other systems.</p>

<p>GeigerLog had initially been developed for the sole use with Geiger counters,
but has now become a more universal tool, which equally well handles
environmental data like tem&shy;pera&shy;ture, barometric-pressure, humidity,
light-intensity, and CO2, and is prepared for future sensors.

<p>In its present state it can e.g. be deployed as a monitor for a remote
weather station, com&shy;ple&shy;mented with a Geiger counter to monitor radioactivity,
and a sensor to moni&shy;tor CO2, with a connection by wire or wireless by WiFi.

<h3><br>Monitoring GeigerLog</h3>

<p>GeigerLog has now its own build-in <b>Web Server</b> allowing to monitor and
partially control GeigerLog with a <b>Smartphone</b>.</p>

<h3><br>Devices Currently Supported by GeigerLog:</h3>

<p><b>GMC Devices:</b><br>GeigerLog continuous to support GQ Electronics's
GMC-3xx, GMC-5xx, and GMC-6xx line of classical Geiger counters, including the
variants with an additional 2nd Geiger tube.</p>

number generator.</p>

<p><b>Manu Devices:</b>
<br>A Pseudo-Device which allows to enter values manually.</p>

<p><b>WiFiServer Devices:</b>
<br>GeigerLog acts as a client to request data from a device which is
acting as a server.</p>

<p><b>WiFiClient Devices:</b>
<br>GeigerLog acts as a server to which devices can connect and deliver data.</p>

<p><b>RaspiI2C Devices:</b>
<br>Only when GeigerLog is running on a Raspi: GeigerLog uses the Raspi I2C options to communicate wth
I2C devices connected to a Raspi.</p>
