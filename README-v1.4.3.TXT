Update an existing installation of GeigerLog 1.4.1 to 1.4.3

If you are using a GMC-600+ counter or one of the new "S" series 
(GMC-300S,GMC-320S) you should apply this update.

After unzipping you find this README and the file: gdev_gmc.py.

Overwrite file gdev_gmc.py existing in the GeigerLog directory 
with this new one.

(the update has been applied to this repo -- ckuethe)
