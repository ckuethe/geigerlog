# All lines beginning with '#' are comments and will be ignored

#       # comment
#       # Options:  value1 | value2 | ...
#       # Default = value
#       parameter = value
#
# NOTE: non-acceptable values will be silently ignored, and replaced with
#       defaults, but a debug message will be printed to the terminal and log file
#
# NOTE: There MUST NOT be more than one entry per parameter, or an error

# If the percent-sign ('%') is to be used anywhere (not recommended), it
# must be entered in duplicate! So, e.g. in a password, having a single '%':

# FIRMWARE BUGS
# GQ's firmware has bugs - no surprise for any software. What makes is bad is
# that GQ is dragging their feet when it comes to a complete disclosure of what
# the problem is, and which firmware versions are effected.
# This impacted not only GeigerLog but also their own Dataviewer software.
# So here is an attempt to allow at least for the GeigerLog user to add some
# work-arounds in case more versions should be affected than currently known.

# FIRMWARE BUGS: LOCATION BUG
# The "saving-to-memory" of the counters uses tags (special byte sequences) to
# itentify certain properties needed for the proper parsing of the data.
# Unfortunately, GQ changed the meaning of some tags when they introduced
# 3 and 4 byte storage values, making these firmwares incompatible with previous
# versions. This was reverted, but devices with that wrong firmware were sold.

# FIRMWARE BUGS: FAST ESTIMATE TIME:

# 2.24 and likely in all other models with a firmware supporting this mode.
# Fortunately it is not present in the GMC-300 and GMC-320 counters.

# This mode is active by default in its worst setting! It invokes an algorithm,
# which is not disclosed by GQ, and which results in a severe distortion of all
# CPM recordings, and may even create counts when there are none.
#
# It has settings of 60, 30, 20, 15, 10 and 5 seconds, plus a 'dynamic' (equal to 3)
# setting, which apparently simply stands for 3 seconds. The latter is the default
# and the worst setting.

# It looks like this algorithm is switched off at 60 seconds, therefore this
# setting is strongly recommended! GeigerLog gives a warning when a GMC counter

# The RM+ can act as a Geiger counter providing CPM data, and with an optional

# Pressure, and Humidity. The RM+ must be configured to send its data to an
# MQTT server. This server's IP must be made known to GeigerLog.
#
# NOTE: The server must be using protocol=mqtt.MQTTv311! The RadMon device is
# not able to connect to a server using the protocol=mqtt.MQTTv31
#
# The RM+ update cycle can be configured at the RM+, but it is best set to
# 60 sec for CPM readings, and with an extra of about 7 sec for reading the
# environmental sensor and for sending the data, the total cycle is about 67 sec.

#
# A configuration is needed which defines 3 settings per sensor, separated by comma:
#   1. Activate the sensor:                             <yes | no>
#   2. The sensors's I2C address in your hardware:      <address as hex value, like: 0x48>
#   3. Mapping of sensor values to GeigerLog variables: see below
#
# 1.Activation
#   If activated, the sensor will be used by GeigerLog. If not, it does not hurt to leave
#   it in the circuitry, and it may also be left powered, but GeigerLog won't talk to it.
#
# 2.I2C Address
#   The address is determined by the sensor manufacturer. It will be in the space of
#   0x00 ... 0xFF (128 addresses). Devices may allow only a single address or multiple,
#   depending on hardware. Sometimes the user can modify it, sometimes not.
#
#   Possible Addresses for the supported sensors:
#       LM75:    0x48 | 0x49 | 0x4A | 0x4B | 0x4C | 0x4D | 0x4E | 0x4F
#       BME280:  0x76 | 0x77
#       SCD30:   0x61
#       SCD41:   0x62
#       TSL2591: 0x29
#       BH1750:  0x23 | 0x5C
#       GDK101:  0x18 | 0x19 | 0x1A | 0x1B
#
# 3.Mapping of sensor values to GeigerLog's variables
#   The sensor values will be delivered from each sensor in the order shown in the table
#   above. Those values need to be mapped to GeigerLog's variables. Any combination of
#   GeigerLog's variables can be used in any order. However, no more variables can be set
#   as the sensor can deliver values; any additional ones will be ignored.
#
#   GeigerLog will skip a variable if the word None is used instead of a variable name.
#
#   Examples:
#   I2CSensorLM75    = yes, 0x48, CPM2nd
#                        The LM75 sensor will be used at I2C address 0x48, and its
#                        Temperature value will be mapped to GeigerLog variable CPM2nd
#   I2CSensorSCD41   = yes, 0x62, CPM, None, CPS1st, Xtra
#                        The SCD41 sensor will be used at I2C address 0x62 (its only one),
#                        and its 3 output values are handled like this:
#                        - its CO2 value is mapped to GeigerLog variable CPM,
#                        - its Temperatur value is skipped, i.e. not registered at all,
#                        - its Humidity value is mapped to CPS1st,
#                        - Xtra is ignored as the sensor can deliver only 3 values.
#
# Options:  < yes | no > , <Sensor Addr in hex> , <any combination of None,
